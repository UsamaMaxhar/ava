manage the votes branch, reverse merge?


think about how I want to display ideas. For example:
	url
	title
	comment count

Change the comments nesting scheme
Think about how to get ideas to have unique pk values

remove comment url (for now, to be impelement betterer later)
Consitent API naming schemes (e.g. username vs owner, idea_list_url, etc, etc.)
Change project url to use slugs instead of pk

think about better ways to implement a `mailing list`



Roadmap:
	Add models to projects: Discussion, Wiki, Problems

discussion -> forum
problems -> github issues
wiki -> wiki
